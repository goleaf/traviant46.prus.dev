# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the maintainers and contributors of the TravianT authentication platform, pledge to foster an open and welcoming environment. We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing appreciation for the time and effort invested by others.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- Violence, threats of violence, or discriminatory jokes and language.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject issues, comments, commits, code, wiki edits, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples include using the official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the TravianT security desk at [security@traviant.com](mailto:security@traviant.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these guidelines when determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** — A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
2. **Warning** — A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
3. **Temporary Ban** — A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
