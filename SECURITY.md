# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The TravianT authentication service is actively maintained on the `main` branch. Security fixes are backported to the latest tagged release when applicable.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| main    | ✅ |
| < latest release | ✅ (critical & high issues only) |
| older tags | ❌ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Use GitHub's **"Report a vulnerability"** workflow to open a private security advisory. Provide reproduction steps, affected endpoints, and any mitigation ideas you have tested.
- If GitHub is unavailable, email the maintainers at `security@traviant.dev`. Encrypt messages with PGP if possible.
- You should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. Triage updates, remediation timelines, and release plans will follow within five business days.
- Do **not** disclose vulnerabilities publicly until a fix has been released and you receive permission from the maintainers.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure. Reporters will be credited in release notes unless they request anonymity. Critical patches are published as quickly as possible and bundled into the next scheduled release for non-critical issues.
